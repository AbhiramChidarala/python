# -----------------------------------NUMPY ---------------------------------
#NumPy, short for Numerical Python, is a fundamental open-source library in Python for scientific computing. 
# It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.
#  along with a comprehensive collection of high-level mathematical functions designed to operate efficiently on these arrays. 


import numpy as np 

#print(np.__version__)           # to find the numpy version 

array = np.array([1,2,3,4,])

array = array * 2  # multipy the array 

print(type(array))

print(array)
